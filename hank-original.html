        Hank is the first dog I’ve ever owned. He was a rescue, thrown out of his original family’s
        home at the age of four months for destroying a pair of eyeglasses. Hank was left to run the
        streets and fend for himself for several weeks, before
        <a href="http://www.cbbr.org">Chicagoland Bully Breed Rescue</a> picked him up and found him
        his permanent home in Chicago.

        In the summertime, Hank loves to cool off in the garden’s damp dirt, which always ends up on
        his tongue. He seems perfectly content to relax among the flowers and leafy plants. He’s not
        allowed in there, but he knows how to use his cute face and happy, goofy demeanor to get
        away with all kinds of things around the house. And he’s always willing to pose for
        <a href="#garden-photo">a photo like this one</a>, especially if he’s caught doing something
        he shouldn’t be.
